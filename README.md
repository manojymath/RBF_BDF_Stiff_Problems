# RBF BDF Methods for Stiff Problems
RBF based backward differentiation methods for stiff differential equations by A. Sreedhar, Manoj Kumar Yadav and Chirala Satyanarayana
#
This repository contain MATLAB scipt files for solving 5 benchmark problems on stiff differential equations.
Classical BDF method of order 2 is used for comparison of performance of Radial Basis Function (RBF) generated BDF methods of order 2.
